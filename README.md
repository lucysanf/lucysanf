- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucy @lucysanf
- 👀 I’m interested in Testing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning APIs Testing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on QA projects using modern tools and technologies... I have not done any formal testing over the past 6 years as I am part of an Infrastructure 
      support team (so yeah, I'm outdated)
